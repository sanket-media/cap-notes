- Restructure - move relevant & important details on top

- Profile description - can we make it sound like more experienced person?

- Skills section - can we adjust the skills in such a way that it forms 3 columns? Would be easier to read

- Experience section
    - Add 2-3 lines about what project was -> this wil help to portray what have you worked on and what all things you would have done

    - Zeus' exp - add individual projects - just as above it can help to add weightage to the experience

    - Along with mobile application also mention web application

    - Introduce terminologies - cross-browser (for web and mobile app) & cross platform testing (for mpbile app)

    - Add - Automating ngrok link update

    - We need to think about adding the term 'STLC' in the experience (this applies for me as well)

    - Add - addressing queries/tickets raised by the clients


- How about we write the points in the experience (project/company exp) in a sequential manner? As in analysis comes first (or last), then test cases, then performing tests and so on...
