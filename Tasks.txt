Pushnami #core
Notes
Use US IP
DB - user optin status entries in leadgen.pushnami_user_optin_status

Push User to Subdomain:
User (new/duplicate) should be redirected to the subdomain regardless of their optin status. Like a force Redirection
Exp level setting → pushUserToSubdomain key in config_data
Force push will not work on the sites which are alias, it will only work on the sites who has an entry in the leadgen_sites table
Redirection timeout
https://trello.com/c/XImqfM4v/3419-make-pushnami-subdomain-redirect-back-to-lander-time-duration-configurable
`leadgen`.ab_experiment_v2 -> config_data -> pushnamiRedirectTimeout
Default = 5000 miliseconds
permanentSubdomainRedirection
Works only on root domains - users are redirected to to subdomain which has the subdomain as current date. Users are not redirected back to root domain
CID level setting -> config -> permanentSubdomainRedirection
Exp level

Device Atlas #core
https://trello.com/c/ozzM70Bb/3310-upgrade-to-device-atlas-package-version-30-for-php
Used to collect and store user’s device information. The ‘accpet-ch’ key is passed in response header of the very first request and in request headers of the subsequent call the data is received and is stored, most likely in image?page-ab request

Email verification using emailable & xverify
https://trello.com/c/i5va4jE8/3402-emailable-for-email-verification
Two entities which would verify the email
Set on config level, in leadgen.campaign_master -> campaign_config
“xverify-emailable”: [ {“op”: , “key”: , “value”: } ]
emailable.score, emailable.disposable, emailable.state, emailable.reason, xverify.status, 	xverify_reason
emailable.score : 0 to 100
emailable.disposable: true, false
emailable.state: deliverable, undeliverable, risky, unknown, duplicate
emailable.reason: accepted_email, invalid_domain, invalid_email, rejected_email, invalid_smtp, low_quality, low_deliverability, no_connect, timeout, unavailable_smtp, unexpected_error
xverify.status : valid, invalid, accept_all, risky, unknown
xverify_reason: verified, invalid_syntax, invalid_domain, mailbox_full, invalid_mailbox, unverifiable, high_risk, complainer, fraud, block_affiliate, block_by_user, block_country, no_result
Kibana logs
for async call: "Async Call for xverify & emailable"
for both responses already present in cache:  "emailable and xverify data present in cache"
for emailable present in cache : "Call xverify, emailable present in cache"
for xverify present in cache: "Call emailable, xverify already present in cache"

CCPA #core
Creating a new key in redis
https://trello.com/c/PCvJWpcp/3339-ccpa-request-handling-for-scheduled-leads-aged-delayed
Earlier, while executing the job for lead posting the DB was being queried to check if the user has raised any CCPA request. It was increasing the load on DB hence now a key is being added into the redis 
Verified deletion/masking PII data  & max_leadgen_sponsor_ad, entry in one_trust, entry in leadgen_unsubscribed_list, event (for the user whose CCPA was raised before lead posting), value of the new redis key
API for checking the new key in redis cluster - https://demo.freesamplesprousa.com/api/get-cache-key/?key=ccpa_request_74933182

Option Pruning
https://trello.com/c/MhHQiXR1/3349-option-pruning-logic-to-be-included-in-auto-survey
Removes the option of a question, the option whose associated tag was removed during survey pruning
Example, tag group (Offer1_QA) → two questions
Q1 → o1 = offer1_qa, o2 = offer2, o3 = offer3
Q2 → o1 = offer1_qa, o2
Now if offer1_qa gets pruned during survey pruning then ‘o1’ from q1 will be removed


================== Core ==================

Lead quality - action taken based upon score
	- https://trello.com/c/Htt7V63k/3730-lead-quality-lead-postings-do-not-post-lead-to-advertiser-based-on-bad-quality-score-of-session
	- Based on the scores generated, actions would be taken:
		- Flag 'LeadsDoNotPostLogActivate'
			- when flag is true and expressions evaluates to true event 'LeadsDoNotPostLogging' logs would be registered
		- Flag 'LeadsDoNotPost'
			- when flag is true and expressions evaluates to true event 'LeadsDoNotPost' leads not be posted
	- Sample config
		"leadQualityConfig": [
		{
		    "LeadQualityExpression": "(lead_score >= 0) ",
		    "LeadsDoNotPost": true,
		    "LeadsDoNotPostLogActivate": true,
		    "AMMDoNotFireConversion": true,
		    "AMMDoNotFireConversionLogActivate": true,
		    "AMMDoNotCreditTxnID": true,
		    "AMMDoNotCreditTxnIDLogActivate": true,
		    "RedirectTo": "403"
		}
		]
	- The config can be set on multiple levels - hierarchy - offer > exp > camp > site
	- The flags which are missing on the current hierarchy level would be fetch from the immediate next hierarchy (will be picked only if the expression of that config is satisfied)
	- Multiple configs can be present on the same level

All table optimization #ono
https://trello.com/c/WWQjKNv6/758-all-tables-optimization-on-cmt-mysql
Unsub + Inactive
Unsub
Email users - delete/mask PII
Phone users - delete company mapping

Adcopy fix:
https://trello.com/c/AqN5LVZz/826-adcopy-to-provider-fix
Problem - the offer text whose provider was not matching with the available route was also being fetched for comparison. In this task this issue has been optimized
Checked if the offer text whose provider is matching with the available route is being selected to send to the user
